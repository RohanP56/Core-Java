All about classes & objects:
----------------------------

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A programming paradigm that intends to solve real-world problems.
- Objects: Programming representations of real-world entities. Each object can store data (attributes) and use behaviours (methods) defined by its class.
- Classes: Templates or blueprints for creating objects, defining what data they hold and what actions they can perform.
- Instance Variables: Variables that are specific to each instance of a class. Each object created from a class has its own set of data, represented by instance variables that hold the object's state.
- Local Variables: Variables that exist within the scope of a block or method. They are created when the block or method is entered, and their scope is limited to that block or method; they are destroyed once it exits.
- Heap Memory: A region of memory used to store objects and arrays in Java. Objects live in the heap and remain in memory as long as they are accessible or referenced by some part of your program.
- Stack Memory: It stores local values and references to objects that are part of method calls and thus have a limited scope.
- Anonymous Objects: Objects created without a named reference, used for immediate operation, typically where an object is needed only for a short period within a method. These are ideal for one-time use, such as passing an object as an argument to a method.
- Garbage Collection: An automatic memory management feature that recycles unused objects on the heap, freeing up memory and preventing memory leaks.
