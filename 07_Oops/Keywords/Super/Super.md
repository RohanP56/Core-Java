# 'super' keyword
The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to the parent class objects. It is commonly used for three main purposes: to access methods of the parent class, to access the constructor of the parent class, and to access fields of the parent class if they are shadowed by subclasses.

### Why Use the super Keyword?
- **Method Overriding:** To call the parent class's method when it has been overridden in a child class.
- **Field Access:** To access fields of the parent class that are hidden or shadowed by child class fields.
