# The Shadowing Problem:

**Variable shadowing occurs when a local variable within a method or constructor has the same name as an instance variable. In such cases, the local variable takes precedence within its scope, effectively "shadowing" the instance variable. This means any attempt to use the shared name within the scope will refer to the local variable instead of the instance variable.**

### Reason for Shadowing Problem:

_The shadowing issue can lead to subtle bugs because it often does not cause immediate, visible errors in the code. Programmers expecting to initialize instance variables can inadvertently end up manipulating the constructor or method parameters instead. This can cause the object's state to not be set up correctly, leading to incorrect behavior or results in the program._

### How to fix this Problem?

**Introducing the 'this' Keyword as a Solution**, The this keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object â€” the object whose method or constructor is being called. You can use this to resolve the ambiguity between instance variables and parameters that have the same names.
