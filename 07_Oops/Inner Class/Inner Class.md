# Inner Class
**Smaller classes nestled inside a bigger class, each with its own special use.**

### Why Would We Want Classes Inside Other Classes?
- **Keeping Things Together:** Just like you keep your study materials in your room, some classes are only useful to one other class. It makes sense to keep them together.
- **Privacy:** Inner classes can access private parts of the outer class. It's like how only family members know what's in the secret storage room of your house.
- **Neat and Tidy:** By nesting classes, your code becomes more organized. It's like having a well-arranged bookshelf in your study room.
- **Easy Access:** An inner class can easily use all parts of its outer class, even the private ones. It's like how you can easily reach everything in your own room.

### Java's inner class family has four types, each with its own purpose:
- **Member Inner Classes:** The helpful younger siblings
- **Static Nested Classes:** The independent cousins
- **Local Classes:** The temporary guests
- **Anonymous Classes:** The one-time helpers
