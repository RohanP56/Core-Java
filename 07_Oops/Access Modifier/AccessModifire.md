# Access modifiers in java
**Access modifiers in Java determine the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and other members. They play a crucial role in securing and structuring your code.**

### 1. The public access modifier
The public access modifier is the most permissive. It allows classes, methods, or fields to be accessed from any other class or package in the Java environment.
``` Java
package com.library.utils;

public class Printer {
    public void print(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}

package com.library.app;

import com.library.utils.Printer;

public class LibraryApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Printer printer = new Printer();
        printer.print("Hello from LibraryApp!");
    }
}
```
*In this example, the Printer class and its method print are declared public, so they can be accessed from any other class in any package, such as LibraryApp.*

### 2. The protected access modifier
The protected access modifier allows access to the class member from within the same package or subclasses in different packages.
``` Java
package com.library.utils;

public class Device {
    protected void activate() {
        System.out.println("Device activated");
    }
}

package com.library.app;

import com.library.utils.Device;

public class SpecialDevice extends Device {
    public void start() {
        activate();  // Accessing protected method
    }
}

public class TestDevice {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpecialDevice specialDevice = new SpecialDevice();
        specialDevice.start();
    }
}
```
*The activate method in the Device class is protected, so it is accessible within its subclass SpecialDevice, even though they are in different packages.*

### 3. The default (No Modifier) access modifier
When no access modifier is specified, Java uses the default access level, which allows the member to be accessible only within the same package.
``` Java
package com.library.data;

class DatabaseConnector {
    void connect() {
        System.out.println("Database connected");
    }
}

package com.library.app;

import com.library.data.DatabaseConnector;

public class DataManager {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DatabaseConnector dbConnector = new DatabaseConnector();
        dbConnector.connect();  // Compile error: connect() is not visible
    }
}
```
*In this example, DatabaseConnector and its method connect have default access. Thus, they cannot be accessed from outside their package com.library.data.*

### 4. The private access modifier
The private access modifier is the most restrictive and allows the members to be accessed only within the same class.
``` Java
package com.library.utils;

public class SecurePrinter {
    private void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("Logging: " + message);
    }

    public void publicPrint(String message) {
        log(message);
    }
}

package com.library.app;

import com.library.utils.SecurePrinter;

public class TestPrinter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SecurePrinter printer = new SecurePrinter();
        printer.publicPrint("Test message");
        printer.log("Test message");  // Compile error: log() has private access in SecurePrinter
    }
}
```
*In this example, the log method of SecurePrinter is private, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside its class, not even from a class in the same package.*


## Visibility of abstract methods

#### Why Can’t Abstract Methods Be Private?
Think of it like this: Abstract methods are like instructions for a robot.
If you make the instructions private, no one can read them, and the robot won’t know what to do.
**In Java, abstract methods are meant to be implemented (filled in) by child classes. If they are private, child classes can’t see or use them, and the whole point of having abstract methods is lost.**

``` Java
class HomeRobot extends Robot {
    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Home Robot is walking slowly.");
    }
    protected void performTask() {
        System.out.println("Home Robot is talking in Hindi.");
    }
}

class FactoryRobot extends Robot {
    public void walk() {
        System.out.println("Factory Robot is walking fast.");
    }
    protected void performTask() {
        System.out.println("Factory Robot is lifting heavy items.");
    }
}
```
*Here, the walk() method is public, so anyone can use it. The performTask() method is protected, so only the child classes (HomeRobot and FactoryRobot) can use it.*

- Abstract methods are like plans or ideas. They don’t have a body (no code inside them).
- Visibility means who can see and use the method.
- Abstract methods can be:
    - **Public**: Everyone can see and use them.
    - **Protected**: Only child classes can see and use them.
    - **Private**: NOT ALLOWED! (Because no one can see or use them, and the plan fails.)

## Method overriding feat. access modifiers
**It’s when a child class takes a method from its parent class and gives it a new twist. You keep the same method name and parameters, but you change what it does.**

#### 1. Public to Public:
- Parent class method is public.
- Child class method must also be public.
``` Java
class Parent {
    public void makeChai() {
        System.out.println("Boil water, add tea leaves, sugar, and milk.");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    public void makeChai() {
        System.out.println("Boil water, add tea leaves, sugar, milk, ginger, and cardamom.");
    }
}
```
*Here, the makeChai() method in the Child class is public, just like in the Parent class.*

#### 2. Protected to Public
- Parent class method is protected.
- Child class method can be protected or public (more visible).
``` Java
class Parent {
    protected void makeChai() {
        System.out.println("Boil water, add tea leaves, sugar, and milk.");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    public void makeChai() {
        System.out.println("Boil water, add tea leaves, sugar, milk, ginger, and cardamom.");
    }
}
```
*Here, the makeChai() method in the Child class is public, which is more visible than protected. This is allowed.*

####  3. Default (Package-Private) to Protected
- Parent class method has default (package-private) access.
- Child class method can be default, protected, or public (same or more visible).
``` Java
class Parent {
    void makeChai() { // Default (package-private) access
        System.out.println("Boil water, add tea leaves, sugar, and milk.");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    protected void makeChai() {
        System.out.println("Boil water, add tea leaves, sugar, milk, ginger, and cardamom.");
    }
}
```
*Here, the makeChai() method in the Child class is protected, which is more visible than default. This is allowed.*

#### 4. Default to Private? NO!
- Parent class method has default (package-private) access.
- Child class method can’t be private (less visible).
``` Java
class Parent {
    void makeChai() { // Default (package-private) access
        System.out.println("Boil water, add tea leaves, sugar, and milk.");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    private void makeChai() { // This will give an ERROR!
        System.out.println("Boil water, add tea leaves, sugar, milk, ginger, and cardamom.");
    }
}
```
*This code will not work because the makeChai() method in the Child class is private, which is less visible than default.*
